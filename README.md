# Numerical-Methods
Different numerical techniques used to solve various problems such as:

Differentiation
Integration
Solving linear set of equations
finding roots of a polynomial equation
Solving non-linear equations
Ordinary Differential Equations (First Order) 
Curve Fitting
Interpolation

Programs:
1. decimal to binary(bits).py - Converts a given real number in to it's corresponding 32 bit form (1 sign bit, 23 bits for mantissa 8 bits for exponent)
2. Base Conversion.py - Converts a number of given base to a specified base.
3. Weighted least square.py - Find the coefficients of polynomial fit to a given dataset. Here the dataset is input-WLS.txt. ( can also be used as linear least squares (assume w[i]=1 as in the example) 
4. machine_epsilon.py - Find the machine epsilon of the given python compiler
5. cholesky.py - solving Ax=b through Cholesky decomposition algorithm
